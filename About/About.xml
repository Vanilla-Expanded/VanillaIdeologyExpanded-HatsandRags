	<description>Vanilla Ideology Expanded is a mini-series of mods aimed at expanding the content in ideology - be it memes, relics and symbols or icons alike.

This mod introduces many new headgear types and one new outfit type for your ideological pawns. No longer you will be limited by the selected few new headwraps and burkas for your Role generation - your leaders will now be able to wear amazing new headgear such as Horse mask or fez, while moralists will adorn themselves in rags, similar to those of typical monks.

On top of that, Vanilla Apparel Expanded apparel is also patched with this mod, allowing it to be desired by ideologies or specific roles! Of course it doesn’t mean it’s random or anything, on the contrary, you can now expect that your shooting specialists might require military apparel, while medical specialists will want to wear medical scrubs.

In case of any feedback or bug reports, please utilise the comment section of the mod on the Steam workshop.</description>
